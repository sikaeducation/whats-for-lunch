## Topic 1: What to Eat

* You want burgers
* Talk about each food item as much as you can:
    * Pizza reminds you of childhood
    * Burgers are an American classic
    * Steak is even more classic
    * Mediterranean seems more exotic than it really is
    * Ramen has such a wide range
    * Poke seems to be everywhere these days
    * Macaroni is a kid's food, but can be fancy
    * Salad might be a little light, but it can definitely satisfy
    * Fish is really good for you
    * Chinese is good comfort food
    * Thai can get really spicy

## Topic 2: Where to Eat

* Talk as long as you can about each topic
* Tell as many stories as you can about each restaurant:
    * You were kicked out of Kikis
    * You got food poisoning once at Iago's
    * You had your first date at Isaac's
    * You watched the last Superbowl from Michelle's
    * You had a great idea for a business at Sarah's
    * Mairin's makes your favorite margaritas
    * One time you took so long finding parking at Aaron's you missed your reservation
* You don't have a strong preference where to go
