## What's For Lunch?

To successfully complete this drill, you need to facilitate a meeting that includes every participant and makes some important decisions about lunch. 

You need 5 people:

* The facilitator
* 3 participants
* An observer, who will keep "score" on the [rubric](rubric.md)

The observer should randomly assign roles to the participants:

* [Aaron](aaron.md)
* [Berto](berto.md)
* [Cass](cass.md)
* [Danny](danny.md)
* [Erin](erin.md)

You should use your real names during the meeting, but follow the instructions for your role. The observer should keep track of who is in the meeting, and whether or not the facilitator reached an acceptable conclusion inside the parameters of the game.

The meeting should have 3 topics:

1. What to eat for lunch
2. Where to go
3. When to leave

The facilitator needs to:

* Post an agenda
* Lead the group to an acceptable decision about all three topics within 5 minutes
* Solicit partication from everyone during each round

If the facilitator makes an error, the observer should stop them at the end of the round and start over from the beginning of the game with new roles.
